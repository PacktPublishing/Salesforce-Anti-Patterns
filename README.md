**Create powerful Salesforce architectures by learning from common mistakes made on the platform**

## What is this book about?
Salesforce Anti-Patterns teaches you how to spot errors in the Salesforce pattern that can seem like a good idea at the time but will end up costing you dearly. The book will enable Salesforce architects and developers to understand how great Salesforce architectures can be created by studying the anti-patterns and solutions to problems that seem like a good idea but inevitably lead to serious problems that are commonly found in Salesforce implementations. While there are several books on the market that start from the question, “How do I create a great Salesforce architecture?” and proceed to a solution from there, this book will instead start from the question “What tends to go wrong with Salesforce architectures?” and proceed to a solution from there. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create a balanced system architecture by identifying common mistakes around on- and off-platform functionality and interfaces
* Avoid security problems that arise from anti-patterns on the Salesforce platform
* Spot common data architecture issues and discover intuitive ways to address them
* Avoid the dual traps of over- and under-customization in your solution architecture
* Explore common errors made in deployment setups, test strategy, and architecture governance
* Understand why bad communication patterns are so overlooked in architecture

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter07.

The code will look like the following:
```
@isTest
class dummyTest{
  static testMethod void notRealTest(){
    //assume A is a class with two methods
    A aInstance = new A();
    aInstance.methodA();
    aInstance.methodB();
    //nothing is done to test anything
  }
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Salesforce architects, aspiring architects, developers, consultants, and decision makers who want to start making the right architectural choices or prepare for their journey to CTA. This book helps you gain a professional understanding of Salesforce and its building blocks. It is not code-centric, so you will benefit from both functional and technical experience, but a basic level of platform understanding is required.
